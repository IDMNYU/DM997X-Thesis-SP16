**List your name:**

**List your thesis title:**

* **Is it a final or working title?**

**What are your career goals?** (What are the next steps for your IDM post-graduation? What industry/industries are you targeting? Are you targeting any particular companies or organizations?)

**Why have you chosen at this particular time to investigate your chosen thesis?**

**What is your "elevator pitch" / Thesis Statement?**<br>
Keep in mind, "What is the project about? What is its theme?"

* It is one sentence, not a paragraph.

* Read [Indiana University's How To Write a Thesis Statement](http://www.indiana.edu/~wts/pamphlets/thesis_statement.shtml) BEFORE you write your thesis statement.

 * First, ask yourself what question is your research trying  to answer? (Please reference the above link.)
 * Secondly, turn that question into a statement. (Please reference the above link.)
 * Do not use **I** in your thesis statement.


* Here's a guide for a starting point: 

 * ***(Working Title)* is a *(What is it?)* that *(What does it do?)* for *(Your Audience)* to *(Why? What's the purpose)*.** 

 * *Note: Obviously you would not leave in the parentheses; it's a just a marker to denote what you should add.*

**List your thesis advisor (if you have one):**

 * Why did you select him or her to be your thesis advisor?

 * Did you meet with him/her over the winter break? If yes, how many times? What did you discuss/question/decide with your thesis advisor over the winter break?

 * Have you worked out a schedule to meet with him/her over this semester? If so, when and how often? If not, do so immediately.

 * If you don’t have a thesis advisor, who have you been in contact with? What was their response? What area(s) of expertise are your seeking in a thesis advisor?

**Discuss your winter progress**
* What did you do over the winter break to make progress on your project? If you did not work on your project over the winter break, own it and say so.

* What did you do over the winter break to make progress on your paper? If you did not work on your paper over the winter break, own it and say so.

* How has your project transformed or shifted over the winter break AND why?
