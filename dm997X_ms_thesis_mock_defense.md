# PROJECT PRESENTATIONS & MOCK THESIS DEFENSES 
Mock thesis defenses will be held on designated Wednesdays, and will consist of the professor, ALL thesis students, and outside critics, at times. 

     Each presentation will consist of 
     * 10 minutes of presentation and 
     * 10 minutes of critique 
     (or a combination thereof)
     for 20 minutes total. 

You are always welcome to invite an outside critic to your project critiques and/or mock thesis defenses. “Outside” might mean a faculty member from IDM, another NYU college, or another university altogether, a mentor from the professional world, an expert in your area of research, etc.  

Critiques (AKA crits) are the best way to articulate your ideas to others and get immediate feedback. During the crit, the professor and/or your classmates analyze and suggest ways to increase the visual and conceptual impact of each existing idea. 
* Have at least two classmates take notes for you when your work is being critiqued and do not edit the responses, whether you agree with them or not. 
* Review your crit notes and reflect upon what was said.
* Ask yourself how you could combine, transform, or expand the ideas that show the most promise. 
* However, resist the temptation to incorporate all suggestions and comments. Only utilize the ones that work for you and your project. 

Rules of the Critique:
* Be Present and Engaged. (i.e. Close your laptops and turn off your cellphones.)
* Give Feedback to your classmates.
* Do NOT take feedback personally.

### General Guidelines for your Mock Thesis Defense Presentation
*This is a general guideline for your mock thesis defense. You can obviously change this to suit your project needs.*

You should present an audio *(if needed)*, visual presentation using a presentation tool of your choice (i.e. powerpoint, keynote, prezi, pdf, video, image files, etc.)

* **Introduce yourself** (as if we did not know you.)
* State **Thesis Statement** (including **target** audience; again, everyone or anybody is NOT a target audience)
* **DEMO YOUR PROJECT**
* **State Your Motivation** (Why are you doing this project?)
* **Show Your Influences** (Competitive or Comparative Analysis of at least 3 other examples of work in the same space)
* **Discuss how your project is advancing your chosen area**
* **Show Research, Design, and Development** (including project iterations and identify your collaborators by name)
* **Discuss User Testing**
* **Discuss Findings**
* **Discuss Plans or Wishes for Future Iterations**
