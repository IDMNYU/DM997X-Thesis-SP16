## BEFORE THE THESIS DEFENSE
* Send your project advisor and thesis instructor a PDF of your complete, compiled thesis paper draft **at least a weekend (preferably a week) before your thesis defense** so either your project advisor or thesis faculty can send it to your external examiner. 
* You want to make sure that everyone has time to read it and make suggestions on how to make it a stronger thesis. 


## AT THE THESIS DEFENSE

* You will have 20 minutes to present.
* There will be 20 minutes of Q&A.
* There will be 20 minutes of deliberation by your Thesis Panel.

Bring *2 copies of the signature pages on acid-free paper* (what you will also print the final Thesis on) or 3 copies if you want to get a bound copy for yourself to the Defense for signing. It is your responsibility to remember to get these signature pages signed.

Please note that there are two different signature pages.

The first is seen in the [NYU SoE's Thesis guidelines](http://engineering.nyu.edu/files/Master's%20Thesis%20and%20Project%20Guidelines_March2014%20version.pdf), (also on slack  under Files as Masters_Thesis_Project_Guidelines_March2014_version.pdf ), and contains spacing for:
* Project Advisor (will sign at the end of the thesis defense) 
* Department Head, Jonathan Soffer (IDM's Academic Advisor, Eric Maiello eric.maiello@nyu.edu, will get the department head's signature once you give him the bound copies)

The second signature page is not in the guidelines. Consult the word template, MS_Thesis_Paper_Preliminaries.doc, for both signature pages (on slack  under Files for formatting). This page is dedicated to the Defense Panel, and should include spacing for:
* Project Advisor
* Co-Director (List De Angela L. Duff)
* External Reviewer


## AFTER THE THESIS DEFENSE

* If your thesis is approved, you will have to bind 2 copies. If you want a bound copy for yourself, bind 3. 
* It takes a minimum of 5 days to bind. 
* The place to bind it is within [NYU SoE's Thesis guidelines](http://engineering.nyu.edu/files/Master's%20Thesis%20and%20Project%20Guidelines_March2014%20version.pdf)<br>(also as Masters_Thesis_Project_Guidelines_March2014_version.pdf on slack under Files).
* The 2 bound copies are due to Eric Maiello BEFORE May 17th.
* The entire thesis should be printed on acid free paper.
* Make sure to include the signed signature pages for binding.
