# THESIS PAPER GUIDELINES

For standard formatting, consult Master's Thesis and Project Guidelines_March2014 version.pdf, the word templates (pinned on Slack), as well as [The Craft of Research, 3rd Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Research-Chicago-Writing-Editing-Publishing/dp/0226065669/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1451843847&sr=8-1&keywords=the+craft+of+research) by Wayne Booth, Gregory Colomb, and Joseph Williams.

What do I mean by COMPILED thesis paper? 
* The body AND the preliminaries (most notably the Table of Contents) in one pdf. 
* Consult the templates pinned on slack. 
 * MS_Thesis_Paper_Body.docx
 * MS_Thesis_Paper_Preliminaries_revised.docx
* Also make sure you include your name in the filename of any file you submit to someone else. I'm getting a lot of thesispaper.pdf but once I download them to my computer I don't know whose paper it is until I open it. Imagine receiving 100 resumes named resume.pdf.

**<font color="#ff0000">In addition to going to the writing center, please have someone other than yourself (or your project advisor for that matter) read and edit all of your writing before you turn it in.</font>** (Even better, have someone read your writing out loud to you.) Include that person's name [and their title and/or relationship with you (if not your accountability partner or other classmate)] at the top of each paper assignment as Editor.

##Assignment: Inciting Question
* Read [Indiana University's How To Write a Thesis Statement](http://www.indiana.edu/~wts/pamphlets/thesis_statement.shtml) BEFORE you write your thesis statement.
* Read Chapter 3: From Topics to Questions of [The Craft of Research, 3rd Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Research-Chicago-Writing-Editing-Publishing/dp/0226065669/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1451843847&sr=8-1&keywords=the+craft+of+research).


    Ask yourself what question is your research trying to answer? 

"Questions that ask who, what, when, or where are important, but they may ask only about matters of
settled fact (though not always). Questions that ask *how** and **why** are more likely to invite deeper research and lead to more interesting answers." - [The Craft of Research, 3rd Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Research-Chicago-Writing-Editing-Publishing/dp/0226065669/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1451843847&sr=8-1&keywords=the+craft+of+research)



## Assignment: The “elevator pitch” / Thesis Statement
* Read [Indiana University's How To Write a Thesis Statement](http://www.indiana.edu/~wts/pamphlets/thesis_statement.shtml) BEFORE you write your thesis statement.
* Read Chapter 4: From Questions to a Problem of [The Craft of Research, 3rd Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Research-Chicago-Writing-Editing-Publishing/dp/0226065669/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1451843847&sr=8-1&keywords=the+craft+of+research).


    Turn the above question into a statement. Do not use **I** in your thesis statement.

Here's a guide for a starting point: 

* **(Working Title)* is a *(What is it?)* that *(What does it do?)* for *(Your Audience)* to *(Why? What's the purpose)*.** 

*Note: Obviously you would not leave in the parentheses; it's a just a marker to denote what you should add.*



## Assignment: Visual Outline or Mind Map
Read **Chapter 15 Communicating Evidence Visually** from [The Craft of Research, 3rd Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Research-Chicago-Writing-Editing-Publishing/dp/0226065669/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1451843847&sr=8-1&keywords=the+craft+of+research).

Use the figures, graphs, and illustrations you will use in your paper. This visual outline will also be extremely helpful in your project presentations and (mock) thesis defenses. 

Or

Look at the example of a mind map on slack, and create a mind map of your paper.

Or 

Create a combination visual outline / mind map

## Assignment: Written Outline
* Read [Indiana University's Using Outlines](http://www.indiana.edu/~wts/pamphlets/outlines.shtml), BEFORE you write your outline.
* Read Quick tip: Outlining and
Storyboarding of [The Craft of Research, 3rd Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Research-Chicago-Writing-Editing-Publishing/dp/0226065669/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1451843847&sr=8-1&keywords=the+craft+of+research)

Recommended structure:
* Section Title
* Section Title
* Section Title

## Assignment: Detailed Written Outline

Review [Indiana University's Using Outlines](http://www.indiana.edu/~wts/pamphlets/outlines.shtml), BEFORE you write your detailed outline.

Create a more detailed written outline by fleshing out they key points of your topics and/or subtopics of your initial written outline.

Recommended structure:
* Section Title
  * Subsection (Optional)
    * Subsection Key Points
  * Section Key Points

  * Subsection (Optional)
    * Subsection Key Points
  * Section Key Points

## Assignment: Body (Background/Context/Rationale)


I recommend you use some sort of version control for keeping track of drafts of your writing. 
* I'd highly recommend writing your paper using **github** (the best version control out there.)
* Secondly, I'd recommend **google drive** (where you can roll back to different versions)
* Worst case scenario, would be creating **manual version control by duplicating your word processing (MS Word, Pages, etc.) file and adding the date to each major draft**.

BEFORE you write your body, read:
* [Indiana University's Paragraphs and Topic Sentences](http://www.indiana.edu/~wts/pamphlets/paragraphs.shtml)
* The following chapters in [The Craft of Research, 3rd Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Research-Chicago-Writing-Editing-Publishing/dp/0226065669/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1451843847&sr=8-1&keywords=the+craft+of+research).
 * 12 Planning
 * 13 Drafting Your Report
 * 14 Revising Your Organization and Argument
