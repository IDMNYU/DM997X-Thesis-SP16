# THESIS PROJECT

You should be [conducting research](dm997X_ms_thesis_research.md) and user testing throughout the ENTIRE semester. Do not wait until the last minute to begin user testing; User testing gives you invaluable feedback about your project. Include the results of your user testing in your thesis paper.

## Assignment: Project Milestones
Break down your milestones into actionable tasks using a system of your choice. All actionable tasks should start with a verb (i.e. write, call, email, build, collect, etc.), and can be completed in a day. Also be specific with your tasks. *(For example, "take 20 photographs" is more explicit than "take photographs". "Take 5 photos of tigers, 5 photos of bears, 5 photos of lizards, and 5 photos of cats" is more explicit than "take 20 photographs".)*

I personally recommend <a href="http://personalkanban.com" target="_blank">Personal Kanban</a>. However, it is not required if you have another system.
<ul>
<li>I recommend using post-its so you can move them around
OR</li>
<li>a digital representation of your milestones using <a href="http://kanbanery.com" target="_blank">kanbanery.com</a>.</li>
</ul>
