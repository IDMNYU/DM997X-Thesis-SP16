## Welcome to MS Thesis In Digital Media!

This is the second semester of a two-semester sequence culminating in a polished thesis defense, a thesis paper, a thesis project, and thesis website, accomplished through a combination of questioning, researching, building/making, writing, iterating, and presenting.

Thesis Projects must go beyond concept and idea; they must be fully realized and functional. The finished project must evidence advancement and/or experimentation, critical and independent thinking, appropriate form, and thorough documentation. Emphasis is placed on effective project planning, professional caliber fabrication and production, real-world user testing, and writing and research of publishable quality. 

The Thesis Project can take many forms, including but not limited to the following: 
* a screen-based, digital application (website, mobile app, game, etc.)
* a physical object, musical instrument, physical game, or interactive installation
* a performance or event, 
* a moving image (animation, film, motion graphics, video web series, etc.)
* audio (podcast, etc.)
* print medium

Thesis research is conducted to find 
* our CONTEXT in the specific realm of knowledge we are engaging in and 
* what remains to be an *open question* where we can contribute our voice in the form of a project. 

## Your Commitment to MS Thesis In Digital Media
Excerpt from the book *Anything You Want* by Derek Sivers

     No “yes.” 
     Either “HELL YEAH!” or “no.”
     If you’re not saying “HELL YEAH!” about something, say “no.” 
     When deciding whether to do something, if you feel anything less than 
     “Wow! That would be amazing! Absolutely! Hell yeah!”
     —then say “no.” 

How are you currently feeling about your thesis project? 
* Yes. 
* Hell Yeah! or 
* No:( 

If you are NOT feeling “Hell Yeah!” about your thesis project, remember your project idea is just that YOURS. I highly suggest you read What is Senior Project in Digital Media?, again, AND the required and recommended readings NOW!

Your thesis project is about the work YOU are and will continue to do, when you are no longer a student. You don’t need anyone to whip you to work because you can NOT, not do it. You will live, eat, breath, and sleep with this project. It is NOT about doing a project for a class or pleasing the Integrated Digital Media faculty. It is about you, your ideas, your concerns, your questions and your passion.

MS Thesis in Digital Media is about demonstrating the maturity, responsibility, and integrity to manage your practice/research/investigation, while having the luxury of constructive critique and feedback from your fellow class mates, faculty, and outside critics. Ultimately, your goal is to COMPLETE a project that has a life beyond school, beyond graduation.

### PROGRAM GOALS

The following IDM program goals are reinforced within this course. At a graduate level, students will:

* develop **conceptual thinking skills** to generate ideas and content in order to solve problems or create opportunities.
  * Students will develop a research and studio practice through inquiry and iteration.
* develop **technical skills** to realize their ideas.
  * Students will understand and utilize tools and technology, while adapting to constantly changing technological paradigms by learning how to learn.
  * Students will be able to integrate/interface different technologies within a technological ecosystem.
* develop **critical thinking skills** that will allow them to analyze and position their work within cultural, historic, aesthetic, economic, and technological contexts.
* gain knowledge of **professional practices and organizations** by developing their verbal, visual, and written communication for documentation and presentation, exhibition and promotion, networking, and career preparation.

### COURSE GOALS

This course will help students deeply:
* question
* research
* build/make
* write
* iterate
* present

### LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of the course, students will be able to develop, complete, and document a thesis that is meaningful and carefully crafted to be used for professional purposes (employment, gallery shows, funding, starting a business, etc.).


### COURSE STRUCTURE

Students are expected to be on time for all meetings, critiques, and presentations. Due to the number of students in this class, you will be assigned to group A or B for individual meetings and/or presentation schedules.

This class will consist of
* Lectures
* Group Discussion
* Individual Meetings
* In-class Peer Critiques
* [Project Demos and Critique](project_demo.md)
* [Mock Thesis Defenses and Critique](dm997X_ms_thesis_mock_defense.md)
* [Thesis Defense](dm997X_ms_thesis_defense.md)
* Self Assessments

### COMMUNICATING WITH THE PROFESSOR OUTSIDE OF CLASS

* Direct message on Slack about logistics (when, where, how many?) ONLY
* Talk to me in person directly after class, during your status meeting, or set up an appointment about issues and problems. DO NOT direct message long conversations. (If your direct message turns into paragraphs that means you should be talking to me in person not direct messaging me.)


### STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES

### EVALUATION & GRADING

##### Attendance

* Attendance is mandatory during project critiques, individual status meetings, and mock thesis defenses. If you miss an individual status meeting, it is your responsibility to exchange a time with a fellow classmate. 
* Unexcused absences will affect your grade. One absence is allowed; after that, your final, overall, numerical grade will drop by 5 percent (1/2 a grade point (e.g. A to an A-)) for each additional absence.
* Be on Time. Tardiness will affect your grade. For every 15 minutes of tardiness, your final, numerical grade will drop by 0.625 percent
* Contact the professor IN ADVANCE if you will not be in class (in person or by email is preferred).

#### Your final grade will be based on a synthesis of quantitative & qualitative rubrics:

##### Quantitative Grading Overview

* 50% Thesis Defense (which includes [Thesis Paper](dm997X_ms_thesis_paper.md) and [Thesis Project](dm997X_ms_thesis_project.md))
