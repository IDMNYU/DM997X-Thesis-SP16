## BEFORE THE THESIS DEFENSE
* Send your project advisor and thesis instructor a PDF of your complete thesis paper draft **at least a weekend (preferably a week) before your thesis defense** so either your project advisor or thesis faculty can send it to your external examiner. 
* You want to make sure that everyone has time to read it and make suggestions on how to make it a stronger thesis. 


## AT THE THESIS DEFENSE

* You will have 20 minutes to present.
* There will be 20 minutes of Q&A.
* There will be 20 minutes of deliberation by your Thesis Panel.

Bring *2 copies of the signature pages on acid-free paper* (what you will print the final Thesis on) or 3 copies if you want to get a bound copy for yourself to the Defense for signing. Please note that there are two different signature pages.

The first is seen in the [NYU SoE's Thesis guidelines](http://engineering.nyu.edu/files/Master's%20Thesis%20and%20Project%20Guidelines_March2014%20version.pdf), (also on slack  under Files as Masters_Thesis_Project_Guidelines_March2014_version.pdf ), and contains spacing for:
* Project Advisor (will sign at the end of the thesis defense) 
* Department Head, Jonathan Soffer (IDM's Academic Advisor, Eric Maiello eric.maiello@nyu.edu, will get the department head's signature once you give him the bound copies)

The second signature page is not in the guidelines. Consult the word template, MS_Thesis_Paper_Preliminaries.doc, for both signature pages (on slack  under Files for formatting). This page is dedicated to the Defense Panel, and should include spacing for:
* Project Advisor
* Co-Director (List De Angela L. Duff)
* External Reviewer


## AFTER THE THESIS DEFENSE

* If your thesis is approved, you will have to bind 2 copies. If you want a bound copy for yourself, bind 3. 
* It takes a minimum of 5 days to bind. 
* The place to bind it is within [NYU SoE's Thesis guidelines](http://engineering.nyu.edu/files/Master's%20Thesis%20and%20Project%20Guidelines_March2014%20version.pdf)<br>(also as Masters_Thesis_Project_Guidelines_March2014_version.pdf on slack under Files).
* The 2 bound copies are due to Eric Maiello BEFORE 12/23.
